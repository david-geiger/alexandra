Description: A small opensource video library with great potential.
 Alexandra Video Library - a simple and convenient program for the organization
 and management of the home video library. You can completely customize the 
 catalog movies in a list or a grid, add a description and detailed information
 about the movie in a lot of fields available, attach posters and much more.
 Directly from the program, you can start playing the film, with the available
 choice of any video player on your computer if you wish.
 .
 There are two types of search: quick - enter words from the keyboard
 immediately after starting the application, and advanced - select the key
 fields and the search terms.
 .
 It is worth noting the random play function of the film, which is especially
 handy when you can not determine which watch movies from your video library.
 .
 The program also displays detailed information about a file using the MediaInfo
 library, so it does not need to resort to using additional software to view
 information about codecs, resolutions, audio tracks, subtitles and other data
 from the selected movie.
