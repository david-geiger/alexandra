### Alexandra Video library
#### v1.3

===

Alexandra Video Library - a simple and convenient program for the organization and management of the home video library. You can completely customize the catalog movies in a list, add a description and detailed information about the movie in a lot of fields available, attach posters and much more. Directly from the program, you can start playing the film, with the available choice of any video player on your computer if you wish.

There are two types of search: quick - enter words from the keyboard immediately after starting the application, and advanced - select the key fields and the search terms.

It is worth noting the random play function of the film, which is especially handy when you can not determine which watch movies from your video library.

The program also displays detailed information about a file using the MediaInfo library, so it does not need to resort to using additional software to view information about codecs, resolutions, audio tracks, subtitles and other data from the selected movie.
